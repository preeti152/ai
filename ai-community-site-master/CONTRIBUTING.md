## How to Contribute

### Blog Post Contributions

A core piece of this community consists of different types of website content. If you are interested in contributing a blog post or similar types of content, we suggest that you share progress early and often with others in the AI community for feedback. Please post about your ideas for blogs in the [Teams Blog channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3abe693c0dc0eb41719f07432a5fcf6cf6%40thread.tacv2/Blog?groupId=a886ded2-d2cb-437c-acbf-e9d200fd8480&tenantId=db05faca-c82a-4b9d-b9c5-0f64b6755421).

### Opening Pull Requests

If this is your first time contributing to an InnerSource or open source project, the following links may help you feel more comfortable:

- [Making Pull Requests](http://makeapullrequest.com/)
- [Contributing to Open Source Projects](https://www.firsttimersonly.com/)
- [Git Forking Basics](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo)

This project uses a forking approach for contributions:

1.  Create your own fork of the code
2.  Do the changes in your fork
3.  Create pull request
    - Use descriptive Pull Request (PR) names
    - If your PR is a Work in Progress (WIP) then prefix the title with "WIP-{descriptive feature name}
4.  A lot of times, making a PR adhere to the standards above can be difficult. If the maintainers notice anything that we'd like changed, we'll ask you to edit your PR before we merge it. There's no need to open a new PR, just edit the existing one.

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
