### Teams & Yammer

Though Microsoft Yammer and Microsoft Teams have a shared goal of facilitating communication, there are notable differences between the two platforms.

The AI Community Yammer feed is a great place to learn about big-picture happenings in the health care AI space. There, team members share the latest news, events and general inquiries that may be of interest to both businesses and technology teams.

The AI Community Teams channel, meanwhile, is primarily a space where AI practitioners can collaborate, help answer technical questions or seek help from others on an innovative idea or project proposal.

Both platforms help reduce silos and foster an environment where everyone can build their knowledge and network with like-minded individuals.

### Community Guidelines
**Purpose**: The purpose of our online communities are to provide a forum for all things AI-related at UHG.

It is a place to:

* Ask general questions about AI capabilities in and outside of UHG.

* Engage with other AI enthusiasts and experts on similar use cases and inspirations.
* Share and learn about new or upcoming events, AI research, and other news.

:::tip Give Context for any URLs you Share

When sharing a link, please add at least one sentence of commentary along with the link so the channel has context. 
*Dont worry, if you forget a bot will remind you*. :wink:

### Community Management

The overall AI Community is lightly moderated by a small team of passionate data scientists, engineers, and general AI enthusiasts and thought leaders; however, the value and direction is generally shaped by those participating in this forum.
