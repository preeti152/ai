Reading and study clubs are a great way to learn about AI and discuss topics with your colleagues. Check out the list of active and forming clubs or start one of your own!


## Start your own 

To keep the conversations engaging, we encourage groups to **self-organize** on a general or specific AI-related topic of each group's choosing.

### Steps to start a club

* Create a simple Teams sign-up form like this [sample form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ShareFormPage.aspx?id=yvoF2yrInUu5xQ9ktnVUIcyse5w6yuBHl76gygA_0kJUNE1IQzNESlRES1JORE1GWTE3OVczQUxLWi4u&sharetoken=QCnKwTKF00mQiQSZaath)
* Update this page with the information about your club:
	* Hosts contact info
	* Vision and goals
	* Status and instructions to sign-up (form or email)
* Once you get between 5-10 people, close the sign-up
* Coordinate with your reading club and agree on a few things:
	* Topic
	* Number of sessions
	* Meeting logistics
* Read, meet and share your notes
