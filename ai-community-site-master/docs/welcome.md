## __About this Community__


The UHG AI Community is focused on bringing all the disparate AI chats, channels, trainings and ideas together into a common AI Community. It is a community of many organizations, technology leaders and AI enthusiasts centered around an active Microsoft Teams community and lightweight website.

The teams channels are the UNITED set of channels dedicated to everything AI:  from socializing academic research papers to asking someone to help with a specific NLP question. The development of the content is in the facilitation of the community conversations. The lightweight website is a spot to share blog posts, discover AI events and trainings (both internal and external), find the documented best practices and AI standards, and see the recommended AI technologies.

### __What it is__

A common place for discussions and the sharing of ideas to naturally take place. The shared links, questions, ideas, and topics for discussion are brought up by the community members and discussed amongst those who want to participate.

### __What it's not__

It's not a Data Science Center of Excellence (COE). AI needs to be a core competency of **_ALL_** of our teams, and this community is the mechanism to bring individuals together from across UHG to discuss ideas, ask questions, share best practices, and ultimtely ensure that each UHG team has what they need to make AI a core competency within their team.

## __Who it is for__

The core goal of this AI Community is aimed at bringing the data scientists across all of UHG together to share links to new techologies and data science libraries and discuss best practices, events, research and academic papers.

### __But I'm not a Data Scientist__

*That's okay!* Whether you're a product leader, software engineer, or hold any other kind of role there is still something here for you. Maybe you want to check out the courses for Business Leaders within the [**College of AI**](/docs/training/uhg-training) or review the glossary to get an understanding of the common AI terms you hear. Maybe you have an idea and would like to ask the broad data science community for their initial reactions.

## __Doesn't this already exist?__

People are sharing their ideas and questions today, ***but*** these activities are taking place in silos across our many businesses and various platforms, including Microsoft Teams, Flowdock, Confluence, and HubConnect, just to name a few.

* 7+ AI related channels in Flowdock
* 8+ AI HubConnect communities
* 8+ Microsoft Teams channels for advanced and emerging technology

This community reduces the silos and fosters an environment for anyone to build up their knowledge, network, and skillsets.
