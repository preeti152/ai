### Responsible Use Of Analytics 

UnitedHealth Group and its subsidiaries around the world (“UnitedHealth Group” or the “enterprise”) are committed to using data-driven solutions to help drive our mission to help people live healthier lives and make the health system work better for everyone.  To meet the needs of those we serve, we must ensure that any data-driven algorithmic solutions, including artificial intelligence, augmented intelligence, automated decision-making, data analytics, and machine learning (collectively, “Artificial Intelligence,” or “AI” solutions), are developed, deployed, and used ethically, responsibly, and in accordance with our mission.  While AI solutions bring substantial benefits, they can have impacts and unintended consequences that are difficult to anticipate, identify, or measure.
