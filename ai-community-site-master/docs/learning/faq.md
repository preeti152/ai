## __Answers to your Questions__

Here are answers to some the common questions from members in the AI community.


### __Can I uses PHI/PII in the cloud?__

The Health Care Cloud team answers this question [here](https://cloud.optum.com/docs/intro/faqs#can-i-use-phipii-data-in-the-cloud).

> PHI/PII data is only allowed in production approved cloud accounts and subscriptions. You must first validate and build out a working non-production implementation of your application in a non-prod account or subscription using dummy/test data. If your workload requires real PHI/PII in non-production, this work should be done in a production account/subscription after a non-production validation with dummy data.

### __What is the chargeback model for the commercial cloud?__

The Health Care Cloud team explains the cost breakdown for using the public cloud [here](https://cloud.optum.com/docs/operational-guides/chargeback).


### __How is this different than OptumIQ Studio?__

OptumIQ Studio is a suite of products and [platforms](https://workbench.optum.ai/) which enable data science teams to build, share, and discover models and analytics that have been developed by others across the enterprise. It also has a virtual Learning curriculum of curated training videos for business and technology leaders or experienced data scientists to consume on their own time.

The UHG AI Community is focused on bringing all the disparate AI chats, channels, trainings and ideas together into a common AI Community. It isn't a single team building an AI platform, building an analytic library or developing models; nor is building new AI training videos. It is a community of many organizations, technology leaders and AI enthusiasts  centered around an active Microsoft Teams community and lightweight website. The teams channels are the UNITED set of channels dedicated to everything AI:  from socializing academic research papers to asking someone to help with a specific NLP question. The development of the content is in the facilitation of the community conversations. The lightweight website is a spot to share blog posts, discover AI events across (both internally and externally), find the documented best practices and AI standards, get direction to internal and external trainings (including OptumIQ Studio Learning), and see the recommended AI technologies (which includes OptumIQ Studio Workbench).
