The UHG AI Community is focused on bringing all the disparate AI chats, channels, trainings and ideas together into a common AI Community. It is a community of many organizations, technology leaders and AI enthusiasts centered around an active Microsoft Teams community and lightweight website. 

The teams channels are the UNITED set of channels dedicated to everything AI:  from socializing academic research papers to asking someone to help with a specific NLP question. The development of the content is in the facilitation of the community conversations. The lightweight website is a spot to share blog posts, discover AI events across (both internally and externally), find the documented best practices and AI standards, get direction to internal and external trainings, and see the recommended AI technologies.
