As you get started on a new team or project, or if you're new to the company, check out the existing AI Platform capabilities.

These platforms may already have the data you need, enable the tools you want and need, or otherwise address some of the challenges ahead with regard to  infrastructure or security patterns, for example.


## __Build, Train, & Deploy ML Models__

## __Explore Connected Data__

If you have a specific problem in mind and want to perform some interactive discovery on connected data, check out the following platforms.

### Healthcare Knowledge Graph

The Healthcare Graph is an enterprise data asset that creates and hosts connected healthcare data at scale. The connected nature of data across domains combined with native graph storage & graph-based processing enables it to provide very niche and differentiating capabilities to our enterprise (like real-time analytics, holistic views/journeys, experience APIs, complex relationships management, etc.). As a key component and primary consumer of the Health Care Platform (HCP), Healthcare Graph is positioned to drive the modernization of data, digital and analytics aspects of UHGâ€™s products and solutions.

While a graph database is at the core of the Healthcare Graph, managing the storage and processing of data, the asset ecosystem has multiple other technology stacks that are working together to bring the overall capability to bear.

### Data Warehouse as a Service (DWaaS)

DWaaS is a growing platform that allows sharing of data securely, without having to move or copy the data into another storage medium. It is multi-cloud and works across different cloud providers, including access of data in DWaaS from on-premise tools and applications. Teams and individuals should consider DWaaS when using independent, departmental data to support my spikey operations workloads and where there are needs to curate one-to-many datasets across a set of solutions that have shared and unshared data elements.
