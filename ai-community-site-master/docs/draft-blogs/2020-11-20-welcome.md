Welcome to the UHG AI Community! 


In this Community you will find content to point you to documentation to leverage existing platforms, reuse something already exists, and chat with employees across UHG on AI related content.

I encourage you to submit your ideas to shape the expansion of this community and welcome you to [publish a blog post](https://github.optum.com/ai-community/ai-community-site/issues/new?assignees=jwilli&labels=blog-post&template=new-blog-post.md&title=), checkout the [available trainings](/docs/training/uhg-training), or otherwise [engage with others across the enterprise](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3acaa60c3a0b83449b891732b0ad5ae22b%40thread.tacv2/General?groupId=a886ded2-d2cb-437c-acbf-e9d200fd8480&tenantId=db05faca-c82a-4b9d-b9c5-0f64b6755421) via Microsoft Teams.

Finally, a huge thank you to all of the community advocates who enthusiastically support the effort and helped launch this community!
