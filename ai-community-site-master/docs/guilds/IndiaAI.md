##  __India AI Guild__

</span>

We are the confluence of AI and data science enthusiasts in India. We are excited about solving the many challenges that health care poses using machine learning, statistics, and computer science. As we work in our respective areas, we realize that to become proficient AI researchers and data scientists we rely on the expertise of fellow AI enthusiasts. Our common goal is to build a thriving community of members that love solving these business challenges through collaboration, are hands-on and keen to strengthen the AI network in all possible forms. Our members love to support each other in resolving technical issues, sharing experiences/best practices, providing feedback and mentorship. We actively engage in discussions on state-of-the-art research papers by way of paper reading, commentary, and code reviews. We also organize virtual or in-person meet ups that allow us to network and identify new opportunities to learn.
