## __Raleigh Data Science Guild__

We are a cohort of data science enthusiasts located in Raleigh, NC who are interested in solving healthcare problems through math, statistics, and computer science. In order to become proficient data scientists and maintain a strong network of technical support, our goal is to build a community centered on hands-on learning and peer-to-peer mentorship. We like to actively engage with academic material by finding opportunities to teach each other and solve business-oriented data science challenges.
