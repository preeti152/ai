title:  About AI for ALL

## Why "AI for ALL"?

The purpose of the AI for All initiative is to increase UnitedHealth Group's competency in artificial intelligence to help fulfil its mission of **helping people live healthier lives and making the health system work better for everyone**.

## Who is it really for?

As the name implies, **AI for ALL** is for everyone. Businesses, clinical and technical teams have a responsibility to learn about how AI can transform products, services, care delivery and operations. Eventually, AI must turn into a core competency for all technology teams and the businesses who deploy them.

The resources on this website are mechanisms to help bring team members together to discuss ideas, ask questions, share best practices and learn more about AI.


## Doesn't this already exist?

Team members are sharing their ideas and questions today, but these activities are taking place in silos across many organizations, departments and communications platforms. This website is intended to be the starting point to help team members find the resources they need.

## What's in it for me?

Here you’ll discover [AI tools](/docs/start/hands-on), [blog posts](/blog), [events](/docs/events/2021-events) and [training opportunities](/docs/learning/training-paths) – both from within the enterprise and from other individuals, groups and businesses.

Now, go see how you can participate in this great [community](/docs/community/community-guidelines)!
