# AI Project Catalog Plan

`DRAFT - 6/3/2021`

<img src="/img/bg-hero.png" alt="ai-art" width="200" align="right" class="newsletter-image" />

## Plan Overview
- **What**: A high-level [catalog | inventory | database] of AI-related [capabilities | products | projects | success stories | case studies]
- **Why**:
	- Is this for internal marketing/awareness to show all AI in our products?
	- Or, is it intended to be an exhaustive inventory with functionality (extract/sort), such as ML models that others could reuse?
- **Who**:
	- Audience: [General/All | Product | Engineering ] Based on "Why" above.  
	- Contributors: Enterprise-wide groups can contribute — start with Santelli direct teams and push down
- **How**:
	- Ideally self-reported/published
	- intake via share Excel, SharePoint or Teams form
	- Microsite table/page
	- Update/Management Process TBD
- **Where**: published to AI.uhg.com — under Hands-on AI or separate top level nav item
- **When**: MVP/pilot in 2021
	- What does it evolve to? Web app?

## Data Collected
- Project Name
- Description/Summary
	- AI/ML model type? (ask tech SME)
	- Is this built on previous models/work?
- Learn more link(s):
	- GIT repo (Can their be multiple code assets, such as a ML model + the UI + other software itself?)
	- Documentation URL
- Value Prop | Opportunity | What’s solved?
- Date [Project start, close, duration, live ETA date?]
- Category [Admin | Clinical]
	- Sub-category [FWAE, prior auth, claims, imaging, etc.]
- Type: [Foundational capability | Application | Platform | Product | Other]
- Team | Department Name
- Leader Name
- Contact Name
- Contact Email

## Questions
- What are we ultimately trying to understand from this? Literally all AI related work? Models that could be commercialized? Success stories running in production?
- Why will be people want to do this? What do they get out of it?
- What do we consider to be successful? Because we won’t get to 100% participation.
- Who else is trying to do this?
- Will the people we would be asking to submit their work know all those relevant details?
- How do we incentivize contributions/updates?  And/or top-down mandate?
