As Synthetic Data is making its way slowly but steadily in enterprises, there is a vast amount of growing literature on this subject. Cancelling out the noise and understanding what it means to AI/ML practitioner is not trivial.

In this blog post, I share my thoughts on 3 trends of synthetic tabular data (vs image or audio) that stood out amongst others, this summer of 2022.

## Synthetic data is becoming a favorite PET

The PET (Privacy Enhancing Technologies) ecosystem encompasses a set of technologies under its belt. Examples of a few well-known technologies are tokenization and anonymization.  In the lastdecade,however, the advances in AI and cloud computing, has brought newer technologies to the forefront.  The back propagation algorithm break through, a steady private investment and DL (Deep Learning) powering many applications in consumer space have created a conducive innovate environment. Per the Stanford AI index report 2022, a private investment roughly about 93.5 billion, has been pumped in 2021. Synthetic tabular data generation is mostly based on GANs (Generative Adversarial Network), a key DL technology.

AI is data hungry and along with that the problems of privacy also getting overly complex. Synthetic data in the privacy realm, is becoming a favorite PET for innovative organizations.

## Synthetic data is hard to navigate

Many enterprises are onto their digital transformation journey and at various levels of maturity. Working their way up in their engineering maturity with DevOps, DataOps and MLOps. Synthetic data is a key enabler of AI capability and a competitive component of Data strategy. There is scarcity of talent and training is not easy either. Finding engineers who have expertise in all three engineering disciplines (App, Data, and ML) with a good understanding of deterministic vs stochastic solutions along with its nuances is hard.  There is also a greater need to articulate the business value of the utility of synthetic data to influence the investment.

## Synthetic data is moving up the cycle

Gartner hype cycle is a reasonably good source to understand which technologies are in which phases from emerging to matured. Synthetic data while still in the innovation trigger phase has moved up from 5-10 to 2-5 years in terms of reaching the plateau. It will not be a surprise that most organizations will start looking at this and figuring out where it fits in their broader strategy.
