What is “ethical AI”?  Honestly, it is a topic that I hadn’t thought much about until I watched a docudrama on Netflix called “The Social Dilemma.”  The film demonstrated the potential harms that algorithms could have on people’s lives (mostly in regard to social media).  It got me thinking about the implications of AI in healthcare and how ethics fit in.

Ethics, is general, can be defined as a set of guiding principles that help determine right from wrong. Applied to AI, it can be thought of as a way to ensure artificial intelligence is being used for good. In our line of work, it’s hard to think of an example where AI wouldn’t be used for good. However we have [**seen firsthand**](https://hub.uhg.com/news/2019-11-8-Use-of-Algorithms-and-Optums-Impact-Pro-Tool/4321) that misuse of tools and algorithms can lead to unintended consequences. Our mission is to help people live healthier lives and make the health system work better for everyone. However, if outputs from an algorithm are used or interpreted in a way that unintentionally favors one population over another, we may be falling short of our mission of making the health system work better for everyone, and impacting the trust individuals have in us.  

My goal for this blog post is to start a conversation. I would love to hear what teams are doing to test for bias in their algorithms, and thoughts on how we can ensure our algorithms are ethical and used by customers and partners as intended. I look forward to your comments!
