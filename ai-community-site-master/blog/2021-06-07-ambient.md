The global population is aging. In the U.S. alone, there are more than 46 million adults over the age of 65, and in 10 years this is expected to double to 90 million. This means by 2030, 1 in 5 Americans will be over the age of 65 years. As you grow older, your health naturally declines, which means more doctor appointments, more hospital journeys and home care visits. Essentially, you need to be constantly watching your own health or the health of loved ones as they age. This is where technology can significantly improve health care delivery.

Ambient Computing is a fundamental shift in the way humans interact with computers. We are moving from interfaces that we actively interact with (such as the PC or the phone) to those that blend into our environment and anticipate our needs (such as smart speakers, like the Amazon Echo or Google Home). Optum’s Advanced Technology Collaborate have been developing Ambient Computing technologies to enable a person’s home environment to perform critical health monitoring and guidance tasks such as; detecting falls, observing daily behavioural patterns for signs of issues and automatically interacting with the user to drive better health behaviours. 

To date we’ve created several solutions that are set to enable healthcare delivery to blend seamlessly into an individual’s home environment. One example is a Medication Prompting Artificial Intelligence (AI). This AI can observe when a user took medication using either Internet of Things (IoT) pill trackers or using smart speaker interactions. It can then learn the user’s pattern of medication adherence, and predict when they are likely to forget to take medication. It can then learn the best time to remind the user to take medication and the best device to remind them with, to minimise the disruptiveness of these messages. This technology, which was incubated in Ireland, is now being transitioned to OptumRx and is on a path to deployment to address the $290B challenge of medication non-adherence.

Another significant challenge for aging in place is detecting health-critical situations, such as falls or an inability for an individual to take care of themselves. We have developed AI-based solutions that use a range of biometric sensors, thermal cameras (Figure 1), motion sensors and even sound sensors, to detect particular high-risk biometric readings and behavioural patterns which require interventions. With these solutions we’ve proved that it is possible to automatically determine whether individuals are able to care for themselves independently, or worse still, have they fallen and require immediate assistance. The future of healthcare is at home and Optum is investing in this future.
