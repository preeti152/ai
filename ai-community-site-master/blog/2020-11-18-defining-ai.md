**ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE** was coined in a summer workshop in 1956 at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire, an effort to duplicate in an artifact what we as people consider our most defining attribute, human intelligence.  The Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence was a seminal event for artificial intelligence as a field.  The founding fathers in the mid 1950s understood the power of neural networks and natural language processing but the necessary technology making the ambitions come to life would be a future innovation.

The artificial intelligence journey from theory to mainstream has evolved in waves.  The early wave in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and most of the 1990s used a variety of approaches including methods and models borrowed from statistics and probability theory.  In the early days of AI, applications, were largely rules based and custom code using statistical approaches.  The figure below illustrates three waves, where Wave 0 dominated the early decades of AI.  These waves are described more fully in a [**blog**](https://www.kerrieholley.com/blog/waves-of-ai).

[**Alan Turing suggested**](http://www.psych.utoronto.ca/users/reingold/courses/ai/turing.html) that machines could be designed to think proposing a test called the “Imitation Game” which would later become known as the Turing test.  The current applications of AI would likely be as unrecognizable to Turing as today’s physics classes would be to Sir Isaac Newton.  Perhaps Turing would still recognize the Wave 0 technology principles that allowed [**a computer to beat reigning world chess champion Garry Kasparov in 1997**](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/deep-blue-beats-kasparov-at-chess). That feat involved a lot of heavy engineering to build a system of logical rules, wherein the machine relied primarily on a programmed understanding of the game of chess.

Wave 1 brought natural language processing (NLP) and other examples of machine learning, allowing scientists to train computer systems to adapt to different situations. Its seminal moment came in 2011 when [**a supercomputer beat two human opponents on a well-known trivia game show**](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/ibm-watson-the-inside-story-of-how-the-jeopardy-winning-supercomputer-was-born-and-what-it-wants-to-do-next/). That accomplishment required the machine to reason vs. working within a structure of predefined rules. Today, NLP is one of the more common applications of AI in health care that can improve the accuracy of reimbursement and quality of care.

In our current Wave 2, which I see as the “spring of AI” AI is rapidly advancing. Thanks to a big boost in computational power over the past few years, machines can now recognize objects and translate speech in real time. Wave 2 AI brings a deeper appreciation of the potential of human-machine collaboration and the engineering of intelligent systems.  Wave 2 introduces deep learning models applied to NLP to improve and accelerate text analytics functions and NLP features.  This is an improvement of the rules-based NLP approaches of Wave 1.  The explosion of innovations in AI with capsules, federated learning, language models, deep learning and more exemplify the growth and potential of AI in Wave 2.

With each wave we have experienced AI winters where investments and research stalled due to unmet expectations of AI. I don’t see this happening going forward.  Companies and business stakeholders will experience what Gartner describes as the trough of disillusionment, but AI will march on.  Research and investments will continue, academia The Big Tech companies see the power of AI as a general-purpose technology and know we are the early stages of building intelligent, smart systems not just prediction models using machine learning.

Its difficult to obtain consensus on the definition of AI but everyone agrees it’s a field of study and research in computer science.  Like the Russian nesting doll, AI is the parent field with subfields like machine learning, deep learning, NLP, computer vision and more.  AI is aspirational and we look back at earlier waves dismissing them as non-AI just as people in the next decades may look back on our heavy use of deep learning as non-AI in the future.  But each wave represents the use of AI although many AI benefits are only achievable using the technologies of Wave 2.

Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are software (and possibly also hardware) systems designed by humans that, given a complex goal, act in the physical or digital dimension by perceiving their environment through data acquisition, interpreting the collected structured or unstructured data, reasoning on the knowledge, or processing the information, derived from this data and deciding an action(s) to take to achieve a given goal.  

A clear and widely understood definition of AI will be critical to the effectiveness of future adoption and transformative activities at UHG.  For example, if we equate machine learning as equal to AI it may limit our imagination and understanding of the art of what’s possible in building smart products and services using AI.  The clarity and practicability of many AI concepts and principles, the art of what’s possible will depend on how business units and the company define AI.  

No definition is likely to be perfect – especially as the technologies and research of AI evolves over time.  Most if not all definitions of AI are complementary to each other and often reflect differences without a distinction.
