## Give people what they want and need with human-centered artificial intelligence
### Test your hypotheses and get feedback from real users

Have you delivered an artificial intelligence (AI) solution that you thought was amazing, but the users of the system didn’t get it? It happens. 

Human-centered artificial intelligence (HCAI) can help us to make sure we are delivering products that people need and want. HCAI is a person-first approach to creating AI products. It incorporates [human-centered design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human-centered_design) principles and [design thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_thinking) to create products that suit human needs and augment human capabilities.

What sorts of problems could we solve with AI? Usually we are trying to create efficiencies. AI can provide some common customer support functions, for example. It could also provide personalization of content and suggested next steps, recommend providers or medical facilities and give clinicians treatment or care plan suggestions. Augmented reality and ambient computing could help people to live more independently as they age.

How can HCAI help us get better outcomes as we solve these challenges?

### Empathize
AI project teams can use formalized processes to get to know their audiences and the perspectives, tasks, challenges, beliefs, concerns and constraints that influence their workflows and priorities. The team can also incorporate data about social determinants of health to better understand the community it is trying to serve. This will help to improve health equity and will provide useful input into ideation about solutions. 

Is this time-consuming? It can be, but it definitely will increase the likelihood of success.

### Ideate
Now immersed in data about the audience and its needs and concerns, the team is better prepared to formulate hypotheses to test. A diverse, multidisciplinary team will do a better job of asking the important questions and challenging potential biases. The team should ask questions about what could go right and what could go wrong.

### Test and retest
Prototype and test concepts with your intended audiences before building anything. You can do low-fidelity paper prototyping or simple interactive wireframes. For a more personalized approach, you could use the [Wizard of Oz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wizard_of_Oz_experiment) method. When you have a working prototype, test that, too. Keep your users engaged during the entire process to ensure that the project doesn’t get off track from what they really need. Use this as an opportunity to further check for bias or potential negative outcomes. Hold the team accountable for making repairs and testing over time to ensure the system is working correctly.

### Build trust
The product builds trust with its audiences through transparency and feedback loops. System users should understand from the user interface how the system works, and they should have a mechanism to provide feedback if they think something might be wrong. It might be appropriate to indicate a level of confidence in the information being presented.

### Conclusion
With HCAI, the human is at the center. If we understand and address real human needs, AI can give us superpowers.
