The journey for obtaining knowledge and experience in the field of AI can be intimidating and overwhelming to those who are new to the technology. But for one group of engineers, this was no contest. And so, they set out to redefine the terms of learning AI.

<!--truncate-->

## Hey Siri, define “Hack-ai-thon”
*“informal; an event, typically lasting several days, in which a group of people without much prior experience in AI concepts trains themselves through sheer discipline, collaboration, and determination and develops a working software in a short amount of time”* 

– the artificially intelligent system spits back a personally curated answer based on individual language usages, searches, and preferences. We are all familiar with Siri and other voice assistants widely available on the market, and the terms “artificial intelligence” and “natural language processing” are becoming part of day-to-day conversation. But how do those who are limited by “natural” intelligence learn the ways of the artificially intelligent? And how, then, are these ideas implemented?

The words surrounding cutting-edge technology are easily recognized, harder to define, and even more challenging to know where to begin learning. Do we start with the complex concepts? The intimidating implementations of? Do we just open a text editor and try something?

The answer to these questions largely depends on individual use cases and – pun intended – intent. For nine women engineers, the answer was Optum’s Global Hackathon. Our intent was “to expose and train women on the latest technologies and provide them a platform to showcase these skills,” with a vision for a culture “where more women will be inspired to attend and benefit from hackathons in the future.” Let’s begin to build it.

With an admirable amount of dedication and a healthy dose of determination, we set out on the path of using the hackathon opportunity to expand our engineering skills into the fields of AI, ML, and NLP. There were three key factors that enabled the rapid growth we required for success:

**One Team** - Initially, we planned to start with just one team, but we received such tremendous response from woman engineers across Optum that we were able to put together two full teams. Our two all-women hackathon teams worked together as One Team, supporting and encouraging each other throughout the hackathon journey.

**Community** – We received tremendous support from our senior leadership, including Distinguished Engineers who guided us in AI and Azure concepts. Sharing our mission and vision with people in our network helped us get connected with senior practitioners in the AI and Azure communities, who we needed to help push these initiatives forward.

**Discipline of Curiosity** – A strong desire to learn combined with discipline was our constant companion and helped us stay on course.

## Hey Siri, what is “hacking into AI”.

*“formal; two weeks of learning and design sessions, with 48 hours to implement the ideas drawn up”*

Those two weeks of sessions were vital to our projects and made possible by AI and Azure experienced individuals who were willing to share their knowledge with us. They were able to answer our questions from “which way of deploying in Azure would best suit our needs” to “which NLP library would you suggest we use". Those conversations gave way to new ideas and colored the team’s decisions going forward. In one of those sessions, Google Dialogflow was brought up – something our team hadn’t considered. That technology soon became the cornerstone of one of the projects and played a significant role in its success.

At the conclusion of the hackathon, we had two completed end-to-end solutions: Enhanced Voice Enrollment ([EVE](https://optum.video.uhc.com/media/NoMansLandHackathonVideo/1_gc8lk8xo)) – a voice-activated service that provides a seamless experience for Medicare enrollment, and [SimpliMed](https://optum.video.uhc.com/media/Team+%22Error+404A+Men+Not+Found%22+Hackathon+Demo/1_ubawh53m) – an online “medical document demystifying” service that condenses large medical documents into short summaries using ML/NLP libraries and offers cognitive services.

## Hey Siri, define “success”. 

*“formal; the acquisition of knowledge not previously had (typically over a short period of time) and applied to concepts not previously known.”*

The completion of each project was just one small piece of the accomplishment for us. If those weeks taught us anything, it was the untapped potential that exists within these fields. The concepts seem raw with possibility and limitless applications. There is space for all skill sets within AI, and true progress is attainable regardless of one’s starting point.

As AI continues to propagate throughout the industry, it is integral to get everyone involved. The concepts are new, but not impossible or as esoteric as they may feel. With some coaching, a little demystifying, and an insatiable thirst for knowledge, there is the ability for boundless growth within this field.

Looking back on the hackathon and the path we took from project inception to project completion, one fact stands firm beyond all others: though powered by the naturally intelligent, there was nothing artificial about this experience.

## Hey Siri, how do I get involved?
