I completed the [AI for Business Leaders Program](https://otu.optumengineer.com/content/ai/ai-for-business-leaders) in the fall of 2020, developed by Optum Tech University’s AI knowledge domain in collaboration with Carnegie Mellon University’s (CMU) Tepper School of Business. I think this is a great course for leaders within our organization and across disciplines, to build an initial and foundational understanding of AI and identify business opportunities that can be enabled by AI. Two key takeaways are first, understanding that Machine Learning (ML) models may be a fit when prediction could be of value in solving a business challenge and how to consider it. A second is understanding the critical nature of the *exploratory data analysis* that’s part of the data science work, which is key to the success of model training, development and achieving target goals when deployed.

The course structure is creating groups aligned to preferred interest from a list of defined, real-world healthcare challenges. Each group’s selected challenge becomes the focus of their capstone, with a presentation given at the end of the course. 
 
Professors from CMU present material specific to their AI area of expertise such as data science, strategy, ethics and others, cadenced and structured in a way that helps to guide each group’s capstone progress. The professors were great about responding to questions and several were also available for individual sessions with groups seeking additional guidance on their capstone. Optum also provides an AI leader who schedules office hours and time with each group to help make connections, guide data exploration, help narrow focus for prediction and feedback on capstone progress.  
 
Given engagements that CMU professors, faculty and their students have with businesses across the world, including UnitedHealth Group, they bring current and meaningful examples into the course teachings which I found to be very valuable. 
 
With travel restrictions in 2020 we weren’t able to be onsite at CMU for the initial two-day kickoff or the one-day conclusion with the capstone experience. From previous cohort feedback, I would anticipate an even more valuable experience than I had with the ability to be at the CMU campus with their professors and your cohort members for those three days.
