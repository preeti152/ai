            <description><![CDATA[Deep learning has enabled significant improvements in NLP (Natural Language Processing) throughout the last year. Transformer  based pretrained models are one of the main reasons behind this revolution in the field of NLP. These new language models can be trained on vast amounts of unlabeled data. The models have shown to learn various syntactic and semantic dependencies between words and phrases that were previously hard to capture. BERT  (Bidirectional Encoder Representations for Transformers) based models have outperformed humans on GLUE  benchmark NLP tasks and have achieved state-of-the-art results on summarization, machine translation, and question answering.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[What is “ethical AI”?  Honestly, it is a topic that I hadn’t thought much about until I watched a docudrama on Netflix called “The Social Dilemma.”  The film demonstrated the potential harms that algorithms could have on people’s lives (mostly in regard to social media).  It got me thinking about the implications of AI in healthcare and how ethics fit in.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE was coined in a summer workshop in 1956 at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire, an effort to duplicate in an artifact what we as people consider are most defining attribute, human intelligence.  The Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence was a seminal event for artificial intelligence as a field.  The founding fathers in the mid 1950s understood the power of neural networks and natural language processing but the necessary technology making the ambitions come to life would be a future innovation.]]></description>
