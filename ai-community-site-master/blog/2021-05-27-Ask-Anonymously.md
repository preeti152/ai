We've heard from meeting with a number of AI Community members, it can be intimidating to post a question to a large audience. In an effort to provide where all community members are comfortable asking questions, we're introducing an "Ask Anonymously" feature as a community experiment.

With this feature, anyone can fill out the [**Ask Anonymously**](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/entity/81fef3a6-72aa-4648-a763-de824aeafb7d/_djb2_msteams_prefix_2333240237?context=%7B%22subEntityId%22%3Anull%2C%22channelId%22%3A%2219%3Ae8c379b417bc4153b3f5e109657105ed%40thread.tacv2%22%7D&groupId=a886ded2-d2cb-437c-acbf-e9d200fd8480&tenantId=db05faca-c82a-4b9d-b9c5-0f64b6755421) form at the top of the `General` & `Help!` Channels in the AI Community in Microsoft Teams. The submitted question is then passed to the Microsoft Teams Flowbot and it will post your question as a new message in the Help! channel as the Flow Bot.

Over the next few months, we will be observing how this feature is used by the AI community members. Please let us know if you find this valuable and any ideas of how we could build upon it.

## Additional Notes

1. Please take note of the *"Unnecessary Reminder (probably)"* message on the form regarding content that is not appropriate for work.
1. The following message will appear on all messages added to the channel by Flow. Your name will not be displayed -- it will always be "Williamson, Jordan."
